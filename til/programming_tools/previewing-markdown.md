# Previewing Markdown

The ability to preview markdown locally, via [Sublime Text Markdown Preview](https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview),  has been a significant aid to producing this document. It has also significantly reduced the number of embarssements I upload to Github. 

I heartily recommend it.
